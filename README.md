# My Advent of Code Solutions

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.
See the language specific folders for the solutions.
Remember that most participants get different input data so the results in the comments and unit tests will likely be different from yours.

## Project Setup

### Inputs

Inputs are loaded from `input/<year>/<day>-input.txt`, where the day is zero-padded.
For example, `input/2022/03-input.txt` for the third day of 2022.

The input directory contains only samples because the inputs are not tracked with git.
This is because the maintainers of Advent of Code asked to not share the inputs (see <https://adventofcode.com/about>).
And also because different users get different inputs.
Simply copy your own from the website and paste it into a file named as described above.

### Solutions

#### Java

The Java project is configured such that the java directory must be used as its working directory because the imports and paths are all relative to there.
But the IDE should be opened here in the project root so it can access all files easily.
See [the readme](java/README.md) for information about how to run the solutions.

#### Python

The Python project is configured such that the python directory must be used as its working directory because the imports and paths are all relative to there.
But the IDE should be opened here in the project root so it can access all files easily.
See [the readme](python/README.md) for more information.

#### R

The R solutions have input paths relative to this directory, so you can open RStudio here.
