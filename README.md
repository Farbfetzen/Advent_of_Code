# My Advent of Code solutions

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.
See the language specific folders for the solutions.
Remember that most participants get different input data so the results in the comments and unit tests will likely be different from yours.

## Project setup

- R: The R solutions have input paths relative to this directory, so you can open RStudio here.
- Python: The Python project is configured such that the python directory should be used as its working directory.
  The imports and paths are all relative to there.
  But the IDE should be opened here in the project root.
  See [the readme](python/README.md) for more information.

The "input" directory contains only samples because the inputs are not tracked with git.
This is because the maintainers of Advent of Code asked to not share the inputs (see <https://adventofcode.com/about>).
And also because different users get different inputs.
