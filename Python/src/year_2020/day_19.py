# Explanation for part 2:
#
# - Rule 8 returns these:
#   (42), (42, 42), (42, 42, 42), ...
#   And rule 11 returns these:
#   (42, 31), (42, 42, 31, 31), (42, 42, 42, 31, 31, 31), ...
#
# - The loopy part comes in the second half of the rules. That means
#   [42] or [42, 31] are already resolved when it is reached.
#
# - In the test rules and challenge rules, rule 0 points directly
#   to 8 and 11 IN THIS ORDER. That means every valid rule must follow
#   one of these patterns:
#   1. left + left:   42, 42, 31
#   2. left + right:  42, 42 * x, 31 * x
#   3. right + left:  42 * x, 42, 31
#   4. right + right: 42 * x, 42 * y, 31 * y
#   They have in common that the left part is all 42, the right part
#   is all 31 and the number of 31 is less than the number of 42.
#
# - Remember: Solve the challenge for the rules given, not any
#   general rules! Start by resolving only rules 31 and 42.
#   Then check the patterns.
#
# - Complication: 42 and 31 have many possibilities. But both are always
#   the same length. I can split each message into n-character words.
